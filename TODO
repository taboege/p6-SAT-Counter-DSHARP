  + Error handling. dsharp and some other solvers print predictable
    messages in common error scenarios, like invalid DIMACS file.

  + Unify interfaces. SAT::Counter should provide the standard role
    for #SAT solvers. Error types should be defined there as well.

  + Configurability. Offer command-line options to callers.

  + Maybe export a sub that hides the object creation and maybe
    a version that automatically awaits the Promise.
